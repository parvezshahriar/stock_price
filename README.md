## Datasets

The application uses historical stock data in `.xlsx` format. Files should be placed in:
Available datasets:

- `Grameenphone.xlsx`
- `Brac bank.xlsx`
- `Beximco.xlsx`

Each dataset must include these columns:  
`date`, `opening_price`, `high`, `low`, `closing_price`.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Linear Regression

- Predicts closing price using opening, high, and low prices.
- **Data Split**: 80% training / 20% testing (`random_state=0`)
- **Accuracy**: R-squared score
- **Prediction**: Uses last 30 days of features

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Uses SVR to model relationships in stock features.
- **Data Split**: 80/20, same as LR
- **Accuracy**: R-squared score
- **Prediction**: Based on recent 30 days' data

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

- Neural network specialized for time series prediction.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Scaled with `MinMaxScaler`
  - Sequences of 60 days created
- **Architecture**:
  - 2 LSTM layers (50 units each)
  - 2 Dense layers (25 units, then 1 output)
- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: `adam`
  - Loss: `mean_squared_error`
  - Epochs: 10, Batch size: 64
- **Accuracy**: `100 - MAPE` (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
